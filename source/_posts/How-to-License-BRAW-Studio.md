## How to License BRAW Studio in Premiere Pro

In order to remove [BRAW Studio](/BRAW_Studio/) 500 frames import trial limit, you'll need to license it in the Settings popup : this is where you'll also find BRAW Studio global settings (such as writing logs, more options might be available later). Here's how in Premiere Pro :

1. Import a .BRAW file

2. Open the **BRAW Studio Source Settings** : add the new clip to a timeline (or create a new sequence from the clip and open the new timeline created), then go to Effects Options panel, and you will see two tabs at the top. Source Settings will be the first tab prefixed <i>"Masterclip"</i>.

 **This is where you'll be able to change all the RAW import params for your .BRAW clips and change the way they are interpreted by BRAW Studio** (see top left of the above image)
3. In the BRAW Studio Source Settings, just click on the <i>"Settings &amp; Licensing"</i> button

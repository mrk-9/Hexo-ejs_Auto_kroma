AfterCodecs uses ffmpeg to encode H264 and H265 :

* Low bitrates videos are of better quality than before
* Choose the efficiency you need : fast encoding for your previews or low filesize for final delivery
* Save time directly in AE render queue without touching the command line and having huge temporary files
* FileSize targetting
